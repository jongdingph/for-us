        <p>Hi mahal ko! Its a little bit absurd that im sending you an email but nonetheless you still love 😜
 
Happy 3rd Monthsarry Love 😚 I know that things got a little rough for the both of us last time (don't wanna mention it anymore) but at least love got us back together. Love, I wont promise anything nor give you a word to hold onto but, I'll give you efforts, time and attention that will stabilize this relationship. 

Love, when things got rough and shady, I just want you to know that I'll be your greatest peace and resting place where you can take a break from anything. I may be a little "maldita" but i know that you know that I'll be your forever baby. ^^

Thank you for all this amazing memories, love. No words can describe how happy I am that we're back together and is creating new memories to cherish and live on for the rest of the time. I love you, Rawen. 💝</p>

        <p>Happy 3rd monthsary satin, mahal!

3 months but for me it's like years already. I still catch myself smiling everytime na nakikita kitang nag me-message every morning, nake-kwento ng chismis, basta, your presence make my day. I swear, you have no idea how you bright my day kapag nandiyan ka, mapa-call man 'yan or chat. 

I'm so happy because I still find my way back home to you. 3 months of break-up never thought na mapupunta tayo sa ganto, never expected this kind of plot twist ng year ko. Kaya I'm so happy that we still found each other.

I appreciate you, your effort, your patience, your kulit, lahat lahat. Thankful din ako kasi natatawag kitang "asawa". Sobrang excited din ako sa mga upcoming small moments na hindi nae-experience before na magagawa natin in the future. So love, whatever happen, mag away, tampuhan, i know this time maha-handle na natin yon. 

 So here to us— cheers sa 3rd monthsary, 3 months down and more na slowly natin binubuo together. I love you, mahal ko!❤️✨</p>
